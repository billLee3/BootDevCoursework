# BootDevCoursework
---
Working through Shells and Terminals course.
Finished Shells and Terminals, GIT, and working to finish out the functional programming course. 

9/4/2025 - Wrote Insertion Sort, MergeSort, and QuickSort
Insertion sort is the only non-recursive sort in this list. 
  Insertion sort is better on short nearly sorted lists
  MergeSort is a stable sort but can eat up memory because of how many duplicates of the list there are
  QuickSort uses a pivot point but can degrade over time if the highest or lowest value is always picked

9/6/2025 - Ran through the stacks portion of the course. Wrote the Balanced Parantheses problem.

9/7/2025 - Worked through queue examples.

9/8/2025 - Worked on linked list portion. Got held up by __iter__ functions (new concept)
